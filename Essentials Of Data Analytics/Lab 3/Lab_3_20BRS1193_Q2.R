# a. Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between father and offspring telomere length.

# b. Do the data require any transformation before analysis using linear regression?

# c. Estimate an equation that predicts the offspring telomere length from its father’s. Is
# there evidence that the father’s telomere length predicts his offspring’s value?
